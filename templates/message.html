            Hey Aditi, it's been more than a month we're talking... 
            I’ve enjoyed every second — the laughs, the jealousy, the sadness.
            Everything’s been amazing. And today’s your birthday 💝

            I wish you the most amazing future ahead, with me or without me.
            You're genuinely an amazing girl. You made me realise
            how lucky I can be to have someone like you.

            We may not be dating, but this attachment?
            It’s precious. It’s rare. It’s... *us* 💞

            Wishing you the happiest birthday, my cutiepie!
            You deserve all the happiness in the universe 🌍
        </p>
