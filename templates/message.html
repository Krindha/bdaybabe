           Hey Aditi

It’s hard to believe it’s already been more than a month since we started talking Time really flies when you enjoy someone’s company this much Every conversation every moment — from the silly laughs to the random jealousy and even the sad or confusing parts — has meant something to me You’ve become such a beautiful part of my days and I genuinely look forward to talking to you no matter what mood I’m in

And today… it’s your birthday 💝

That alone makes this day so special to me too because it’s the day someone as amazing as you came into this world I want to wish you the happiest birthday ever — a day filled with love surprises peace and laughter I hope the year ahead brings you everything your heart desires — whether that includes me or not You truly deserve the best in every possible way

You’ve made such a deep impact on me even in such a short time It’s crazy how someone can walk into your life out of nowhere and suddenly mean so much You’ve made me realise how lucky I am — just to know you to talk to you to share even the tiniest parts of life with you

We may not be in a relationship but what we share It’s not ordinary This attachment this connection… it’s rare It’s real It’s something I can’t exactly define but I feel it deeply And it’s ours 💞

You have this way of making things better just by being yourself — your energy your kindness your charm Whether it’s a random meme a thoughtful message or a teasing joke — you leave your mark every single time

So here’s to you my cutiepie On your special day I hope you know how valued loved and appreciated you are — not just today but every day You bring something magical into the world and into my life

Wishing you nothing less than all the happiness the universe has to offer 🌍
Happy Birthday again Aditi You’re truly one of a kind 💫
